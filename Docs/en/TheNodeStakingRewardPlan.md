## **The Node Staking Reward Plan**

In order to better stimulate the development of node ecology, Diskcoin Foundation will launch the Node Staking Reward Plan, all issued Diskcoin rewards will be distributed by the Foundation, and all miners are welcome to submit application for rewards.

### **Participation in the Node Staking Reward Plan rules**

1. The Staking amount needs more than 1000DISC.

2. The settlement time of the reward is after the start of the new DC.

3. The reward plan will start from block height 27001.

4. The reward of the DC (N-2) will be settled at the beginning of the DC (N). For example, Staking statistics start at block height 27001, settle after 30,600, and issue reward for the 15th difficulty cycle (height 27001~28800). Once unstaked before 30600, there is no reward.

5. Online submission of the Staking txid participating in the reward plan.

### **FAQ**

#### 1. What is the purpose of the plan?

We hope that more nodes will be able to participate in the ecosystem. For example, if you have a wallet, you can launch a Staking financial plan for your users.

#### 2. Who is the Node Staking Reward Plan mainly for?

Mainly for mining pools, wallets, exchanges and other institutions, so the participation threshold starts at least 1000 DISC.

#### 3. What do I need to submit to participate in the plan?

Online submission of the Staked txid participating in the reward plan.

#### 4. The more Diskcoin I Staked, the more rewards I will get? Or as long as the Staked amount more than 1000 DISC?

Each Staking needs more than 1000 DISC. The more Diskcoin you Staked, the more rewards you will get.

#### 5. Can Staked amount add up to more than 1000 DISC to get rewards?

Each Staking needs more than 1000 DISC.

#### 6. How long does it take to get a reward?

The Staking needs to last for at least 2 DC to receive a reward. The reward of the DC (N-2) will be settled at the beginning of the DC (N). For example, Staking statistics start at block height 27001, settle after 30,600, and issue reward for the 15th difficulty cycle (height 27001~28800). Once unstaked before 30600, there is no reward.

#### 7. I am mining in the pool. Can I get the reward for the plan?

You can contact the mining pool to ask if they have any incentives.

#### 8. When will the reward start to settle?

The settlement time of the reward is after the start of the new DC. The reward of the DC (N-2) will be settled at the beginning of the DC (N).

#### 9. When will the plan start?

Start at block height 27001.

#### 10. How will the reward be issued?

The reward will be issued to the stake out address.

#### 11. Where does the rewarded Diskcoin come from?

All issued Diskcoin rewards will be distributed by the Diskcoin Foundation.

#### 12. What is the relationship between the plan and the DES mechanism or pool Staking?

The two are not directly related and do not affect each other. For miners, the equivalent of Staking has double reward.

#### 13. What is the reward rate for the DC?

The reward rate for the 15th DC is 2%, and the incentive rate is reduced by 10% for every five DC thereafter.
For example, if you Staked 1000 DISC in 15th DC and does not unstake until the 16th DC, the 15th DC reward is 1000*2% = 20 DISC.
